##Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
Data gathered from experiments that were carried out with a group of 30 subjects. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.<br>

Goal of this project is to create an R script named __run_analysis.R__ that performs the following tasks.

1. Reads in all relevant data.
2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. Data set labelled with descriptive variable names. 
6. Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
